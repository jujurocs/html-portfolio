<h3>Mahal (1949)</h3>
<p>Mahal is a psychological thriller for most of it's length.  The famous song "aayega aanewala" is used to great effect.  The movie holds no punches in showing us the utter despair Hari puts all around him through, especially his wife.  There is an interesting scene at one point where a snake & bat are facing each other (two creatures with poor vision) probably symbolizing that both husband & wife are unable to see things clearly in their lives.</p>
<h3>Madhumati (1958) </h3>
<p>While driving his car on a rainy night, Anand's car breaks down, and he goes to seek shelter in a nearby house. He is let into the house by the servant, and he is permitted to stay until the rains stop be able to get his car fixed. It is here that he will find out about his previous birth, his true love, Madhumati, their ill-fated, star-crossed and tragic romance, and how events in his previous birth are going to effect him in this life-time.</p>
<h3>Bees Saal Baad (1962) </h3>
<p>Kumar (Biswajeet) is the last in a long line of Chandangarh zamindars. He returns to his lonely ancestral manor where his father had been mysteriously killed after he was lured into the fields by the sound of anklets and a woman crying. Rumours abound of the ghost of a woman raped and killed by Kumar’s ancestor. Kumar falls for the local belle Radha (Rehman) and meets a gallery of dubious characters: an ex- con servant, a bearded doctor and a man on crutches who turns out to be a disguised policeman. The first half of the film builds up the suspense, mostly using the soundtrack according to generic conventions. The plot then becomes a whodunit until the murderer is revealed: Radha’s guardian (M. Krishna), the father of the woman killed 20 years ago. Waheeda’s seduction number, associating her with the ghost, is the classic Kahin deep jale kahin dil (sung by Lata Mangeshkar).</p>
